## Your first neural net
 * Start Anaconda prompt in CNTK env using the CNTK icon on desktop
 * Download the book GitHub repo from https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks
 * Open the first notebook in Jupyter `2.1-a-first-look-at-a-neural-network.ipynb`
 * Got through that notebook with the following modifications
   * Draw some of the digits using `imshow()` function to see how they look like.
   * Why are the digits represented by 2D arrays?
   * Why imshow() draws a blue/yellow image? How to convert it to black and white?
   * Use `time.time()` to measure exactly how long it takes to train the network (how long the `fit()` function runs)
   * After finishing the notebook, train a decision tree classifier using sklearn and compare the accuracy
   * Try to use sklearn train_test_split function to split the training data into training and validation set
